# MCC

MCC - MineCraftClone - Small Java voxel sandbox prototype built with LWJGL, OpenGL, JOML, and ImGui.

## Current Features

- Chunk-based voxel world generation
- Client/server architecture over UDP
- On-demand chunk streaming from the server
- Block breaking and placement synchronized over the network
- Heartbeat packets to keep client connections alive
- Client-side chunk request TTL to avoid spamming duplicate requests
- Automatic unloading of chunks that stay outside render distance for too long
- ImGui debug overlay with runtime information
- CLI arguments for server IP, port, render distance, and server world file

### Planned Features

- Player models
- More advanced rendering pipeline (greedy meshing, shadows, point light torches)

## Controls

- `W A S D`: move
- `Mouse`: look around
- `Space`: jump
- `Left Shift`: sprint
- `Left Click`: break block
- `Right Click`: place block
- `Middle Click`: pick block
- `Mouse Wheel`: cycle selected block
- `Esc`: close the game

## Requirements

- Java 21
- Maven
- A platform that supports LWJGL/OpenGL

## How To Run

### 1. Compile

```bash
mvn -q -DskipTests compile
```

If your shell still defaults to an older JDK, set `JAVA_HOME` to Java 21 first.

Example on Linux:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
mvn -q -DskipTests compile
```

## CLI Arguments

### Server

- `--port=<number>`
- `--server-port=<number>`
- `--world-file=<path>` defaults to `world.json`

### Client

- `--server-ip=<host>`
- `--server-host=<host>`
- `--server-port=<number>`
- `--port=<number>`
- `--render-distance=<number>`

## Debug Overlay

The in-game debug menu currently shows:

- FPS
- player position, direction, and velocity
- current chunk and chunk hash
- compressed chunk size
- selected block
- loaded chunk count
- connected server IP and port
- sent packet count
- received packet count

## Notes

- The server loads chunks from the configured world file on startup and saves the full world on JVM shutdown hooks such as `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`.

This is a simple Minecraft clone I made to learn Java. Since we all know that the minecraft is the only non-enterprise use case for Java this seemed like the only viable project idea.
